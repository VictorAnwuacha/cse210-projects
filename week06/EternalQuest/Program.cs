/*
    Eternal Quest - Goal Tracker
    ============================
    This program exceeds the core requirements in the following ways:

    1. Improved User Experience
       - Clear and user-friendly menu system.
       - Input validation to prevent errors.
       - Goals display formatted status indicators ([âœ“] for completed, [ ] for incomplete).

    2. Persistent Data with File I/O
       - Goals, progress, and scores are saved and loaded from a file.
       - The program restores user progress on relaunch.

    3. Advanced Goal Logic and Gamification
       - Checklist goals track progress and award points incrementally.
       - A bonus is granted when a checklist goal is fully completed.
       - Eternal goals cannot be marked complete, aligning with their purpose.

    4. Strong Object-Oriented Design
       - Encapsulation: All member variables are private or protected.
       - Inheritance: All goal types inherit from the base Goal class.
       - Polymorphism: Key methods are properly overridden.

    5. Organized and Scalable Code
       - Methods are structured for easy modifications.
       - New goal types can be added with minimal changes.

    This implementation improves usability, persistence, and scalability, making it a more maintainable system.
